My slides for the [Workshop on 'Vascular imaging using contrast-enhanced microCT approach'](https://www.ana.unibe.ch/weiterbildung/microct_workshop/index_ger.html).
The slides are essentially a subset [of the slides from my talk at the 2019 Bruker User Meeting](https://github.com/habi/Talk.2019.BrukerUserMeeting).
